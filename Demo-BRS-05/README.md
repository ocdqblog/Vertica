# Demo-BRS-05

Machine Learning Demo using Baseball Related Statistics (BRS).

This demo was used in my Baseball Data Analysis Challenge: https://www.ocdqblog.com/home/baseball-data-analysis-challenge

The raw data used in this demo was collected via a paid subscription to: https://stathead.com/baseball/ 

The input data comes from: [BRS_2016_2021_Batting_input.csv](https://github.com/ocdqblog/Vertica/blob/main/csv/BRS_2016_2021_Batting_input.csv)

( Input data profiling results come from: [BRS_2016_2021_Batting_profile.csv](https://github.com/ocdqblog/Vertica/blob/main/csv/BRS_2016_2021_Batting_profile.csv) )

The input data represents 6 years (2016-2021) of Boston Red Sox Major League Baseball (MLB) regular season baseball game results, including a Game_Result response column, labeled either 0 or 1, where 0 = Loss and 1 = Win.

The prepared data can also be viewed in: [BRS_2016_2021_WP_input.csv](https://github.com/ocdqblog/Vertica/blob/main/csv/BRS_2016_2021_WP_input.csv)

( Prepared data profiling results can also be viewed in: [BRS_2016_2021_WP_profile.csv](https://github.com/ocdqblog/Vertica/blob/main/csv/BRS_2016_2021_WP_profile.csv) )

The SQL files above (named in order of execution) contain the queries and results that will walk you through the demo.

The output data for this demo can also be viewed in: [BRS_2016_2021_win_probability.csv](https://github.com/ocdqblog/Vertica/blob/main/csv/BRS_2016_2021_win_probability.csv)
